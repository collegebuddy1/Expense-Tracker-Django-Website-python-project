- Expense Tracker is a Django based web application for splitting expenses with your friends. 
- It lets you and your friends add various bills and keep track of who owes who, 
and then it helps you to settle up with each other.

- This application is to help users to track a user's personal expenses, his/her contribution towards group expenses, maintain monthly income, recurring payments, and to settle all the shares on the spot. 
- It also provides information of “who owes who and by how much”.
